👋 Hi, I’m Cedric from Nanyang Technological University (NTU)

😎 Welcome to my Github repo page!

📌 I'm passionate about product management <br>
📌 I have a strong interest in doing tech-related side projects (SEO, currently learning Vue.js) and I'm also working on a Telegram Bot 🤖 which searches for information on skincare ingredients
