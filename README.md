ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Cedric from Nanyang Business School

Welcome to my Github repo page!ðŸ˜Ž

I am currently an undergraduate studying Business at Nanyang Technological University (NTU). In my spare time, I write articles at [Medium](https://cedric130813.medium.com/) and create product design mockups at [Behance](https://www.behance.net/cedric130813) and other areas related to [product management](https://cedric130813.github.io/projects). I am also currently working on a [Telegram Bot](http://t.me/Beigen21Bot) which searches information on skincare ingredients, after spending some time to learn other new technologies including SalesForce, Zoho CRM and Front-End ([on this website](https://cedric130813.github.io/)).
